        "\n",
        "**Ans.**\n",
        "In SQL, an index is a database object that provides a quick and efficient method for looking up rows in a table based on the values in one or more columns. Indexes play a crucial role in optimizing query performance by allowing the database engine to locate and retrieve data more rapidly. Instead of scanning the entire table, the database can use the index to directly access the rows that satisfy the conditions specified in a query.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some common types of indexes in SQL:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  1.Clustered Index:\n",
        "\n",
        "      A clustered index determines the physical order of the data in the table.\n",
        "      There can be only one clustered index per table because the data rows themselves are stored in the order defined by the clustered index.\n",
        "      When a table has a clustered index, the rows are stored on disk in the same order as the index.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2.Non-Clustered Index:\n",
        "\n",
        "      A non-clustered index does not affect the physical order of the data on disk.\n",
        "      The index contains a separate structure that includes a mapping of index key values to the corresponding row locations.\n",
        "      A table can have multiple non-clustered indexes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3.Unique Index:\n",
        "\n",
        "      A unique index ensures that the values in the indexed columns are unique across all rows in the table.\n",
        "      It is similar to a non-clustered index but enforces uniqueness.\n",
        "\n",
        "These are just a few examples of index types in SQL. The choice of which index to use depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the data, as well as the types of queries that need to be optimized. Keep in mind that while indexes can significantly improve query performance, they also introduce overhead during data modification operations (inserts, updates, and deletes), so they should be chosen and maintained carefully based on the workload and usage patterns."
